<p>2020 will mark 15 years since the EU launched the <b>Global Approach to Migration and Mobility (GAMM) – </b>an overarching framework of the EU's external migration and asylum policy. The framework defines how the EU conducts its policy dialogues and cooperation with the non-EU countries. The GAMM agenda comprises the objectives ranging from organizing legal migration - to preventing and combatting irregular migration; preventing human trafficking; maximizing the development impact of migration; promoting international protection and more. </p>

<p>GAMM's cooperation frameworks - <i>Mobility Partnership</i> (MP) and <i>Common Agendas for Migration and Mobility</i> (CAMM) prompted further numerous cooperation dialogues and the visa liberalization processes around the globe and particularly in the EU's immediate neighborhood. </p>

<p>This Book is to provide a comprehensive overview of the European Union’s approach to Migration and Mobility since 2005. It also aims to examine what role does migration and mobility between the EU and her partner countries play in transferring ideas and practices, knowledge and know-how; financial and business ties; and norms and policies. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the aim is to examine how and why the EU influences (if it does) economic, institutional and normative transformations and/or causes backlashes in its Southern and Eastern Neighborhood, in Latin America and Caribbean, and in selected CAMM countries (Ethiopia, Nigeria and India). </p>

<p>We invite chapters that deal with any of the following sub-topics along the theme (the list is not exhaustive) both for single country cases and dealing with the EU’s partner regions in general. </p>
